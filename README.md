# Employee Management 

The Employee Management System is a web application built using **Angular 19** that allows users to manage employee records efficiently. The application interacts with a backend API hosted at https://projectapi.gerasim.in to perform CRUD operations on employee data.

## Features
- Secure **Admin Authentication** system.
- Employee **CRUD Operations**:
  - Add new employees.
  - View employee details.
  - Update employee records.
  - Delete employees.
- Add, Update and View Project of recorded employees
- **Dashboard** for managing employees.
- **LocalStorage Support** for admin sessions.

## Development server
To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve --port 4209
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4209/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

Work in progress.....
